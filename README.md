### php
This folder contains PHP scripts used for server-side operations, particularly for interacting with a MySQL database. It's crucial for handling backend operations such as database connections, queries, and data manipulation.

**Using Retrofit2 with Kotlin for Connection to MySQL Database:**
Retrofit2 is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It's commonly used to make HTTP requests to a web service or API and process the response. In this project, Retrofit2 is utilized for establishing a connection between a Kotlin-based Android application and a MySQL database. 

Retrofit2 is configured to contact the specific URL `https://cityconnectapp.000webhostapp.com/student/` by calling the PHP code located in this directory. The PHP scripts handle the backend operations such as database interactions.
